        <h3>A Little About Robin</h3>
        <p>
          Robin McLaurin Williams (July 21, 1951 â€“ August 11, 2014) was an
          American actor and comedian. Born in Chicago, Williams started as a
          stand-up comedian in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the mid-1970s.
          He is credited with leading San Francisco's comedy renaissance.[1]
          After rising to fame as an alien called Mork in the TV sci-fi sitcom
          series Mork & Mindy, Williams established a career in both stand-up
          comedy and feature film acting. He was known for his improvisational
          skills. Williams won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor
          for his performance as psychologist Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting.
          He also received two Emmy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, two
          Screen Actors Guild Awards, and four Grammy Awards throughout his
          career. On August 11, 2014, Williams passed away.
